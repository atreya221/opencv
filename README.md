# Clone of Google Teachable Machine

## User Instructions

1. Clone the repository on your local system using 'git clone' command from bash shell.

2. Move into the directory into which the project is cloned using 'cd opencv/'.

3. Depending on the command which invokes python 3.x on your system, run 'python setup.py' or 'python3 setup.py'. This will build all the required dependencies into a virtual environment to be used in the project.

4. Now move into the 'Image_classifier' directory and run 'python script.py' or 'python3 script.py' (as done earlier).

5. Enter the class names whose images are to be classified, the path of the directory containing the training set images when prompted. Once the training is over, the model can be tested by providing path of the test image when prompted.

6. In order to run the handwritten digit recognizer module, move into the 'Digit_recognizer' directory and run the notebook 'MNIST_notebook.ipynb'.
